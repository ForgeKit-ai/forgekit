# ForgeKit

ForgeKit is a modular scaffolding tool that helps you spin up full‑stack projects with your choice of frontend, backend and UI frameworks. It creates the initial directory structure, initializes Git and installs required dependencies so you can start coding right away.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Git installed and available in your PATH

## Example Usage

Install the package globally and run the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @forgekit/cli
forge
```

Running `forge` will prompt you step‑by‑step for a frontend, UI library, backend
and optional database. Choices are filtered so only compatible combinations are
shown. The project is created in the directory where you executed the command
and when scaffolding finishes you will be dropped into a shell inside the new
project folder.

The tool can also be configured programmatically. Example configuration from the project plan:

```ts
{
  projectName: "acme-site",
  frontend: "react-vite",
  backend: "express",
  ui: "tailwind",
  targetDir: "./acme-site"
}
```

You can also use `npx` without installing globally:

```bash
npx @forgekit/cli
```
This behaves the same as the global install, prompting for details and placing
you in the newly created project directory when finished.

If the `forge` command is not found after a global install, ensure your npm
global bin directory is in your `PATH`.
You can typically add it with:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(npm bin -g)"
```

You can verify your environment at any time with the built in doctor command:

```bash
forge --doctor
```

## Purpose

ForgeKit aims to streamline bootstrapping modern JavaScript projects by providing a collection of ready‑to‑use stacks with minimal setup hassle.

## Maintainers

When stack options change (for example in `src/registries/modularOptions.js`), run

```bash
npm run generate-stack-docs
```

to refresh `STACKS.md`.
